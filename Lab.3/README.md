# Laboratory Work Nr. 3

### Objectives
 - Study the behavioral design patterns;
 - Implement them in a program;

### Task
Create a program which implements 5 Behavioral Design Patterns.

### Theory
In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and 
realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication.

Below are presented some of the behavioral patterns:
 - Chain of responsibility - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects;
 - Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object;
 - Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program;
 - Iterator - Sequentially access the elements of a collection;
 - Mediator - Defines simplified communication between classes;
 - Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state;
 - Null Object - Designed to act as a default value of an object;
 - Observer - A way of notifying change to a number of classes;
 - State - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes;
 - Strategy - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class;
 - Template - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass;
 - Visitor - Defines a new operation to a class without change;
 
  ### Implementation
